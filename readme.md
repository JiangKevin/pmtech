A lightweight code base with powerful features that can be used for games and real-time graphics applications. This project focuses on data-oriented and multithreaded systems with minimalistic c-style api's and a strong emphasis on performance.

Take a look at: 
[demos...](https://polymonster.github.io/index.html)

**Platforms**  
- OS: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android (wip).  Â 
- Renderers: Direct3D11, OpenGL3.1+, OpenGLES3+, Metal (wip).   
- Compilers: vs2017, Clang 6, Apple LLVM 9, Gcc 7. 

**Features**  
- Multithreaded - Async render, physics, audio and component entity system. 
- Data-oriented Component Entity System - SoA memory layout for blazing fast scene representation.
- Pmfx - High level data driven renderer, shader and post-processing system.
- Cross platform low-level abstractions - Input, Gamepad, Timers, Threads, Window, Filesystem, etc.
- Hot loading - reload configs, shaders, models and textures in real time for rapid development.
- Tools - Graphical editor, volume texture / signed distance field generator.
- Asset Pipeline - binary model and skeleton format, texture compression, platform agnostic shader compilation.
